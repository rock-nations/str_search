# strs_fe_assessment_v1

Frontend engineer assessment: build a training dashboard where a candidate picks a property, underwrites it, submits, and sees their accuracy against the analyst reference.

- `backend/` — FastAPI + Postgres API (see `backend/README.md` for setup and the endpoint contract).

Run the API (Docker is the only requirement):

```bash
cd backend
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/docs.
